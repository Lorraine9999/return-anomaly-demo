# S&P 600 Return Anomaly Detection (Best Work for Invesco Quant Analyst)

This repository contains my code submission for the Invesco Quant Analyst, Solutions Research application.

## Project Overview

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates a supervised machine learning pipeline for detecting return-driven anomalies in the S&P 600 equity universe. The project covers feature engineering, statistical anomaly labeling, Random Forest modeling, and signal-driven portfolio risk management with performance and stress test analysis.

## How to Use

1. Download and open `Return_model.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or Google Colab.
2. Follow the notebook cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.
3. Example data schema and requirements are described within the notebook.

## Key Modules

- Data Preparation & Feature Engineering
- Supervised Anomaly Detection (Random Forest)
- Feature Importance & Lasso Selection
- Unsupervised Baseline (Isolation Forest, PCA)
- Signal-Based Portfolio Backtest
- Monte Carlo VaR & Scenario Stress Test
